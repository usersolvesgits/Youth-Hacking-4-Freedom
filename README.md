## 📘 General Overview / What Is Youth Hacking 4 Freedom (YH4F)?
**“Youth Hacking 4 Freedom”** is a programming competition organized by the **FSFE (Free Software Foundation Europe)** aimed at European teenagers aged 14 to 18, where participants develop an original, open-source project based on their own ideas.  

The contest introduces teenagers to the principles of Free Software and responsible technology, while giving them the opportunity to turn their own ideas into real projects, learn programming and project management skills, and contribute to the Free Software community.  

This is our project for the 5th edition of Youth Hacking 4 Freedom.  
Everything in the project, from design to development to documentation, was handled by the participants.

You can find more details about the people behind the project in the [👥 Team Members](#-team-members) section below.
