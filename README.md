## 📘 General Overview / What Is Youth Hacking for Freedom (YH4F)?
**“Youth Hacking 4 Freedom”** is a programming competition organized by the **FSFE (Free Software Foundation Europe)** aimed at European teenagers aged 14 to 18, where participants develop an original, open-source project based on their own ideas.  

The contest introduces teenagers to the principles of Free Software and responsible technology, while giving them the opportunity to turn their own ideas into real projects, learn programming and project management skills, and contribute to the Free Software community.
